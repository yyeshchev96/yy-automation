### Hi there 👋

My name is Yevhen and I'm **Test Automation Engineer** with nearly **8** years of experience. 

My main tech stack is built around **Python 🐍** with a high focus on **TestOps** tools, including **Kubernetes**, **Docker** and **AWS**. 
Besides that, I'm obsessed with **Playwright** and **Web Scrapping** frameworks. 

Outside of work, I'm an avid reader and music enthusiast who enjoys continuous learning and self-improvement 🤓. 

Whether you need advice, guidance, or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out to me. 

I'd be happy to help you in any way I can!
